# QA Learning Journey

## Introduction
This repository documents my journey in learning Quality Assurance (QA) based on the roadmap provided by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/qa). 

## Roadmap
The QA roadmap includes the following key areas:
- **Basics of QA**: Understanding QA principles, types of testing, etc.
- **Test Planning**: Creating test plans, test cases, etc.
- **Manual Testing**: Performing manual testing and reporting issues.
- **Automation Testing**: Learning about test automation tools and frameworks.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines.
