# QA Learning Journey

## Introduction
This repository documents my journey in learning Quality Assurance (QA) based on the roadmap provided by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/qa). 

## Roadmap
The QA roadmap includes the following key areas:
- **Basics of QA**: Understanding QA principles, types of testing, etc.
- **Test Planning**: Creating test plans, test cases, etc.
- **Manual Testing**: Performing manual testing and reporting issues.
- **Automation Testing**: Learning about test automation tools and frameworks.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines.

## Projects
### Project 1: To-Do List Website Testing with Cypress
- **Description**: This project involved testing a self-made to-do list website using Cypress. I created automated test cases to verify that all core functionalities such as adding, editing, deleting, and completing tasks worked as expected.
    - Tested user interactions including task creation, task status updates (complete/incomplete), and deletion.
    - Implemented both functional and end-to-end tests using Cypress to ensure all features performed correctly across different browsers.
    - Used Cypress Dashboard for test runs and detailed reporting of test results.
